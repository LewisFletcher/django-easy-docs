# Customizing

## Customizing the template
If you would like to customize the template, you can do so by copying the `easy_docs` folder from the `templates` directory in the `easy_docs` app to your own templates directory. You can then make any changes you would like to the template.

## Customizing the CSS
If you would like to customize the CSS, you can do so by copying the `easy_docs` folder from the `static` directory in the `easy_docs` app to your own static directory. You can then make any changes you would like to the CSS.

## Future Customization
In the future, I plan to add the ability to customize the template and CSS via the settings.py file. If you would like to see this feature added, please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LewisFletcher/django-easy-docs) and I will add it in a future release.
